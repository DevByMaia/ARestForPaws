				<!-- Paragraphs -->
								
								<p>If you’ve ever owned a pet, you’ve likely wondered whether they remember anything about you when you’re gone. The way my aunt’s dog, Zorba, greets me at the door whenever I visit would suggest he has short-term memory issues—an enthusiasm bordering on unhinged, as if I’ve just returned from a ten-year exile and not, say, visiting for the second time in a week. But in reality, animals seem to have memories as mysterious and fickle as our own, yet with some undeniably strange twists.</p>
								<p><strong>The Elephant in the Room</strong></p>
								<p>Everyone has heard that elephants remember everything. We’ve been told time and again they’re the savants of the animal kingdom. Legend has it they remember each other, remember places, even remember specific humans—like, say, a particularly pushy zookeeper who tried to make them perform tricks. I once read about an elephant who recognized a handler it hadn’t seen in over twenty years. </p>
								<p>And it’s not just people or events they remember. They apparently have an intricate mental map of places they’ve been—water sources, shaded spots, places to avoid—like they’re walking Google Maps with tusks. Meanwhile, we’re over here using GPS to figure out where we’re going. The elephant is both humbling and, frankly, a little unsettling. And, yes, they hold grudges, but that’s another story.</p>
								<p><strong>The Goldfish Myth and Other Creatures of Dubious Recall <p></strong>
								<p>We’ve all heard that goldfish have a memory span of three seconds, which is both horrifying and, if true, a massive design flaw. Imagine you’re just swimming around, content as can be, and every three seconds you forget where you are. “Oh! A castle!” you think, only to forget it the moment you swim past. But here’s the thing: the three-second memory is just a myth. Goldfish truly remember things for months. Not everything, of course—they’re not out here recalling epic underwater tales or holding onto dreams of grandeur. But if you teach a goldfish to swim through a hoop, it’ll remember the trick.</p>
								<p><strong>The Cat Only Pretends to Forget</strong></p>
								<p>Cats, it turns out, have excellent memories and often choose to ignore them. Studies show they can remember events, people, even gestures up to ten years later. Yet try calling their name, and they’ll look at you with that expression that says, <span><i>I’ve never seen you before in my life, stranger.</i></span> Cats seem to store memories selectively, retrieving them only when it benefits their latest plot for world domination.</p>
								<p><strong>The Forgetful Dog</strong></p>
								<p>This brings me back to Zorba, who may or may not be faking his apparent memory issues. Dogs have a strange relationship with memory. They’re great with routines—he knows exactly when it’s time for his walk, exactly which couch is technically off-limits but lounges on anyway. But when it comes to events, they have what scientists call an “episodic-like memory.” Zorba will remember the feeling of joy, or fear, or guilt (usually from finding his way into a loaf of bread). But the event itself? That’s gone. Dogs live in a sort of eternal present moment, a forever now, where yesterday’s garbage binge is a distant, hazy thrill. If only we could all forget our mistakes that easily.</p>
								<p>And still, they’ll remember you. They’ll remember the sound of your car pulling in, the way your footsteps hit the floorboards, the scent of your clothes. They’ll also remember exactly where you keep the treats, which suggests dogs remember what matters most. In Zorba’s case, that’s anything edible, followed closely by squeaky toys, my aunt, and possibly me somewhere on the list.</p>
								<p><strong>The Peculiar Case of the Crow</strong></p>
								<p>Then there are crows, whose memories border on the sinister. Crows recognize faces, remember them, and even pass that information on to other crows. If you anger one, it’ll teach its friends to hate you, too. There was a story about a group of researchers who wore masks when they trapped and released crows for tagging. Long after the experiments ended, crows would attack anyone wearing those same masks. That’s dedication. It’s one thing to hold a grudge, but it’s another thing entirely to form a crow-based coalition of revenge.</p>
								<p>And it’s not just enemies they remember. Crows will also recognize people who are nice to them, gifting them tokens—buttons, pebbles, even human knickknacks. They’re like the ultimate spies with a sentimental streak. You don’t just get a pebble from a crow by chance. That pebble says, <span><i>I see you. I remember what you did. Here, take this as proof.</i></span> These gestures are movingly kind.</p>
								<p><strong>Of Mice and Memory</strong></p>
								<p>And then, of course, we have mice, who are experts at remembering things that relate to survival—namely, mazes and hiding places. This is likely the evolutionary result of living in a world full of predators and cramped quarters. They’re great at figuring out a path once and following it precisely every time afterward. Forgetfulness, for a mouse, isn’t just inconvenient; it’s lethal. If I was constantly navigating through narrow tunnels with an owl hovering nearby, I’d probably develop a photographic memory, too.</p>
								<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
								<p>The takeaway here is that animals don’t have memories the way we do. Some have maps in their heads, others store grudges or feelings, while some, like Zorba the dog, can only seem to manage a sort of routine recall. Still, maybe that’s the whole point. They remember what matters: what brings food, where the water is, who has the squeaky toy.</p>
								<p>So, the next time your dog forgets that they’ve already greeted you ten times today, or your cat stares blankly when you call them, remember this: they know what’s important, and everything else is just gravy. And let’s face it, when we get down to it, maybe the elephant’s iron-clad recall or the crow’s penchant for grudges are a bit too much. Life’s better when we leave a little room to forget. Or, at the very least, forget where the snacks are hidden.</p>
