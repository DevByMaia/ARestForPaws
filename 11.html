<p>Anal gland expression is exactly what it sounds like. Deep within the mystery that is your pet's posterior lie two glands, quietly doing their job‚Äîuntil they don‚Äôt. These glands naturally empty when a dog or cat goes to the bathroom, releasing a not-so-charming fluid. But if they get blocked, your poor pet is left with a butt full of angst and a very unfortunate aroma. This is where you, the owner, are expected to step in as a sort of reluctant proctologist.</p>
<p>There are some tell-tale signs that your pet‚Äôs glands are misbehaving. These include that familiar fishy odor, constant scooting across the living room rug (RIP, beige carpeting), and the occasional desperate licking session. At the more dramatic end of the spectrum, you might notice your pet straining while attempting to relieve itself, or, worse yet, leaving little ‚Äúgifts‚Äù in unexpected places around the house. Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it: it‚Äôs an itchy, uncomfortable affair for your furry friend. For you, it‚Äôs a crash course in tolerance.</p>
<p>Now, some people hear all this and decide, "Yes, I can handle this myself." I imagine these are the same brave souls who perform their own home repairs and never hesitate to fix a leaking faucet. For the rest of us, there's the veterinarian‚Äîsomeone trained to roll up their sleeves and get down to business with a well-gloved hand and a bottle of lubricant. </p>
<p>There are two methods for expressing these glands: external and internal. The external method is apparently the ‚ÄúDIY-friendly‚Äù version, which sounds dubious at best. To do this, you gather your supplies: gloves, lubricant, towels, and probably a generous supply of pet treats to bribe your way through the ordeal. You lift your pet's tail, locate the glands, which sit roughly at five o'clock and seven o'clock around the anus, and give a gentle squeeze. If this sounds suspiciously like trying to squeeze toothpaste from a slightly used tube, you‚Äôre not far off. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the internal method is a procedure best left to the professionals. It involves inserting a lubricated finger inside the pet's rectum, a sentence I never thought I'd write. This technique allows for a more ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù expression, though ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù here feels like a word being used optimistically, like describing a root canal as ‚Äúextensive dental care.‚Äù </p>
<p>Either way, you‚Äôll know if something is wrong if the fluid looks strange, the glands are swollen, or your pet suddenly turns into a Tasmanian devil. At that point, it‚Äôs best to call a veterinarian and possibly apologize in advance for your pet‚Äôs behavior.</p>
<p>The idea of learning how to express a pet's anal glands is something that I imagine can only be justified by the kind of love that would make one donate a kidney or attend a high school play. We do these things not because they are pleasant, but because they are necessary‚Äîthough that doesn‚Äôt stop many from considering it the ultimate expression of devotion.</p>
