<p>I love makeup. There‚Äôs something almost magical about a well-chosen lip product or the perfect swipe of mascara. I used to think that animal testing for cosmetics was a relic of the past, something that vanished a few decades ago, but it‚Äôs still happening. Cosmetics testing on animals, specifically on rabbits and rodents, sends me spiraling down a rabbit hole (pun painfully intended) that no amount of hairspray or nail polish could ever fix.</p>
<p>Across the globe, rabbits, guinea pigs, mice, and rats are the go-to subjects for testing cosmetic safety. These tests involve putting chemicals in rabbits‚Äô eyes, rubbing irritants onto their skin, and repeatedly force-feeding rodents to see how much it takes to cause serious illness‚Äîor worse. Pain relief isn‚Äôt part of the program, and when testing is done, the animals are killed in ways that are just as inhumane as the experiments themselves. </p>
<p>Perhaps the strongest argument against animal testing is that we don‚Äôt even need to do it anymore. Modern methods that don‚Äôt involve animals‚Äîtests on human cells, computer simulations, databases of safe ingredients‚Äî are all faster and more reliable than torturing animals. And yet, somehow, these lab experiments continue in some parts of the world.</p>
<p>Countries like India and nations in the European Union have said ‚Äúenough,‚Äù banning animal testing for cosmetics altogether. In 2013, the European Union set the standard, completely outlawing animal testing and the sale of animal-tested products. The UK, as part of the EU at the time, adopted and kept this ban. Other countries, like Israel, New Zealand, Turkey, and Norway, quickly followed to make animal-tested cosmetics illegal in their markets.</p>
<p>Canada joined this cruelty-free movement in 2023, outlawing animal testing for cosmetics and banning the sale of cosmetics tested on animals. Australia also took a stand in 2020, and South Korea and Taiwan now prohibit animal testing on cosmetics, though there are still some exceptions for ‚Äúspecial-use‚Äù products in certain regions. Even China‚Äîhistorically one of the strictest countries on animal testing‚Äîchanged its requirements in 2021. Now, imported ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù cosmetics, such as makeup, shampoo, and lotions, can be sold in China without animal testing if brands provide alternative safety data. However, ‚Äúspecial-use‚Äù products, like sunscreens and hair dyes, still require testing unless they‚Äôre produced domestically.</p>
<p>In the United States, a nationwide ban hasn‚Äôt yet been achieved although several states have taken the lead. California, Nevada, and Illinois started the trend by banning the sale of animal-tested cosmetics in 2020. Since then, Virginia, Maryland, Maine, Hawaii, New Jersey, Louisiana, and New York have passed similar laws. The Humane Cosmetics Act has been introduced to ban such testing at the federal level, but it has yet to pass. </p>
<p>Mandates aside, some of the biggest names in beauty have made the leap to cruelty-free production. Bath & Body Works, NYX, Too Faced‚Äîthey get a pass. They‚Äôre proof that highlighter can be stunning without adding a little extra horror to the world. Others? They still opt to go through the whole ghastly routine. L‚ÄôOr√©al, Maybelline, Dior, Clinique, though adored by many, come with a backstory that should probably be disclosed on the label.</p>
<p>One day, perhaps soon, we‚Äôll look back at these tests and wonder how we ever justified mascara by misery. For now at least, every swipe of cruelty-free product feels like a small, sweet victory.</p>
