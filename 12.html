				<!-- Paragraphs -->
								
<p>Sugar‚Äîof the dynamic duo Sugar & Spice‚Äîwas one of two hamsters from the same litter that I adopted from a local pet store at the end of my freshman year at Essex Tech, after entering the veterinary program. I had walked into the store that day intending to buy one hamster, but there she was: a little puff of white with silver highlights, being held by an employee who was hyping up her beauty and gentle demeanor to two half-interested customers. When they walked away, I asked the employee to pick her back up. She was housed with several other littermates, all with soft brown fur. I chose the most interesting-looking of her mates and brought the pair home.</p>
<p>As an aspiring vet tech and eventual veterinarian, my plan for Sugar and her sister Spice was to give them perfect lives: a balanced diet, plenty of rest and exercise, proper lighting, and a carefully curated habitat. At Essex Tech, we care for an assortment of animals: cows, chickens, goats, birds, snakes, rabbits, gerbils, mice, and, of course, hamsters. As barnyard or classroom animals, they are cared for, studied, and even loved, but none receive the kind of one-on-one attention that personal pets do.</p>
<p>Spice, shy and reserved, preferred to stay in the background. But Sugar thrived in the spotlight. Her "resume" was packed with activities she adored: cuddling, conquering obstacle courses, greeting strangers, and snacking on walnuts. When placed on a computer keyboard, she would step thoughtfully across the keys, pausing dramatically as if to check her progress. Sugar became famous among my friends and classmates, often serving as a star in class presentations.</p>
<p>When Sugar first fell ill just after I started my junior year, I panicked. The first symptom was almost imperceptible‚Äîa faint redness around her eyes‚Äîbut it immediately set off alarms. I needed a vet, but who treats hamsters? I soon found out that not many do. Most clinics cater exclusively to dogs and cats. Call after call resulted in referrals to other clinics, each offering no solutions. Eventually, one clinic agreed to see her. By then, Sugar had grown quiet, and her breathing was more labored than usual.</p>
<p>The vet provided Sugar with oxygen and medication for suspected pain and possible infection, but beyond that, there was little to be done. She was too small and fragile for sedation, which ruled out more invasive tests. As I sat alone with the vet, I began to understand how difficult it must be to deliver bad news in a professional setting.</p>
<p>"I wish there were more I could tell you," the vet said. "Or that she will recover. I‚Äôm worried about her, and the outcome doesn‚Äôt look good.‚Äù</p>
<p>Sugar passed away at home. I could have chosen euthanasia, but instead, I emptied my savings from a summer job to buy more medication. For a while, she seemed to improve, though her legs were weak. She managed only two slow revolutions on her wheel before needing to rest. That last week felt endless. I rushed home every day, anxious to ask my family, who watched over her while I was at school, for updates. My greatest fear was that she would die while I was away, but she waited for me. That Saturday evening, I held her in a white towel, gave her applesauce and her medication, and she found one last surge of energy‚Äînearly leaping from the towel‚Äîbefore sitting back and leaving this world.</p>
<p>All I know about a good life and death, I learned from her: Be daring, bold, and curious. Enjoy the company of friends. Extend goodwill to everyone you meet. Love and be loved. You may plan and do everything perfectly, but the end can still come unexpectedly. So savor the present moment.</p>
