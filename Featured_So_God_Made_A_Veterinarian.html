								<p><i>This feature borrows the style of the speech <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/paulharveysogodmadeafarmer.htm" target="_blank">"So God Made a Farmer"</a>, which was given at the 1978 Future Farmers of America convention by Paul Harvey (9/4/1918 - 2/28/2009), an American radio broadcaster. As he praises farmers, he ends each description with the title phrase.</i>
								<p>And on the 8th day, God looked down on their planned paradise and said, "I need an animal doctor." </p>
								<p><strong>--So <span style="font-size: 25px; color:#a9a9a9">G</span>od made a <span style="font-size: 25px; color:#00bfff">V</span>eterinarian.</strong></p>
								<p>God said, "I need somebody willing to look after each and every one of the animals I have created: canines, felines, rodents, reptiles, avians, and livestock, all while possessing the medical knowledge needed and maintaining a professional demeanor at all times." </p>
								<p><strong>--So <span style="font-size: 25px; color:#a9a9a9">G</span>od made a <span style="font-size: 25px; color:#00bfff">V</span>eterinarian.</strong></p>
								<p>"I need somebody who has the mental capacity to bear witness to the losses of beloved animals then tend to healthy ones within the same shift. Somebody to call and inform owners, tame cantankerous puppies and kittens, come to lunch break hungry, have to wait lunch until the schedule is clear while still being able to stomach it after working with animals‚Äô bodily fluids, then tell owners that they‚Äôll hear back from the clinic real soon with laboratory test results‚Äì and mean it.‚Äù</p>
								<p><strong>--So <span style="font-size: 25px; color:#a9a9a9">G</span>od made a <span style="font-size: 25px; color:#00bfff">V</span>eterinarian.</strong></p>
								<p>God said, "I need somebody willing to sit up all night treating a sick or injured animal, and watch it die, then dry their eyes and say, <span><i>Maybe in another life.</i></span> I need somebody who can be studious enough to complete piles and piles of bookwork, can stay active on their feet for hours at a time, who can administer medications orally, intravenously, and subcutaneously. And who, during puppy and kitten season, will finish each vaccine by noon, then, pain‚Äôn from physical exams back-to-back, see more patients the rest of the day."</p> 
								<p><strong>--So <span style="font-size: 25px; color:#a9a9a9">G</span>od made a <span style="font-size: 25px; color:#00bfff">V</span>eterinarian.</strong></p>
								<p>God had to have somebody willing to perform a spay and neuter at double speed in time for the next client and yet accept an emergency case to dress a wound and save an animal before it is too late.</p>
								<p><strong>--So <span style="font-size: 25px; color:#a9a9a9">G</span>od made a <span style="font-size: 25px; color:#00bfff">V</span>eterinarian.</strong></p>
								<p>God said, "They need to be somebody strong enough to lift a mastiff using the proper technique, yet gentle enough to precisely cut then stitch tissue and skin during a surgery, who will not stop monitoring a patient until it is time for them to be discharged. It had to be somebody who‚Äôd work efficiently but carefully and not cut corners. Somebody to care, prepare, spare, repair, from a hare to a mare, and give and take and talk treatment plans and perform procedures and determine a diagnosis and finish a hard week‚Äôs work with regret for pets who could not be saved but relief for those who could."</p>
								<p><strong>--So <span style="font-size: 25px; color:#a9a9a9">G</span>od made a <span style="font-size: 25px; color:#00bfff">V</span>eterinarian.</strong></p>
								<p>"Somebody who‚Äôd bale a clinic together with the soft, strong bonds of healing, who would laugh, and then sigh, and then reply, with smiling eyes, when the kids that are pet owners say they want to spend their lives <span><i>helping animals like you do.</i></span>"</p>
								<p><strong>--So <span style="font-size: 25px; color:#a9a9a9">G</span>od made a <span style="font-size: 25px; color:#00bfff">V</span>eterinarian.</strong></p>
