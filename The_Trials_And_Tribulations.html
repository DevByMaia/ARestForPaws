				<!-- Paragraphs -->
								

<p>At a pet store, one can purchase not only the required supplies for a pet but also an
indefinite bond with a furry, scaly, or feathery friend. Often considered substandard to pet
adoption centers to many, as expressed via the popular slogan "adopt, don‚Äôt shop," pet stores
pose no inherent issue, but the vast majority tend to practice unsuitable, even unethical standards
in how they care for their animals, as well as where they source their animals from. These
retailers- the most prominent in the United States being PetSmart and Petco- generate billions of
dollars and claim to be knowledgeable about the pets they sell, but a multitude of factors, from
the pets‚Äô lack of enrichment to blatant abuse, reflect that they do not practice what they preach.
Pet stores should not be eradicated entirely- a notion typically associated with extremist groups,
who focus on animal rights rather than animal welfare- however, these issues must be addressed
and relieved accordingly. Whether the issues stem from lack of education or indifference due to
corporate greed, the mistreatment of small animals in retail pet stores is a widespread problem,
but with appropriate action, pets in their habitats will thrive, not simply survive.
</p>

<p>Currently, no distinct, federal piece of legislature regarding pet retailers exists. The
closest animal welfare law, albeit for research, teaching, testing, and exhibition animals, is the
Animal Welfare Act, enacted in 1966 as the first law of its kind, which iterates proper treatment
and care in the listed environments.<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>1</sup></a> While crucial 
in outlining the plain fact that animals are not to be neglected or exploited, the act does not formally 
apply to pet stores themselves but the wholesale breeders who supply the stores with their animals and 
only suggests bare minimum standards of care in said contexts. The animals encompassed by the act are dogs, 
cats, primates, and several other warm-blooded animals, not birds, rats, mice, reptiles, fish, 
and amphibians.<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>4</sup></a> The latter animals- excluding amphibians- 
have not been accommodated for today‚Äôs society; keeping a rat, mouse, reptile, and even bird or fish as a pet is 
far more common now than it was in the sixties when the act was enacted. Despite the act not directly pertaining to 
pet stores, it serves as a basic guideline for any instance in which animals are involved, meaning that all pets and 
their care should be valued on the same tier. Amended for the sole sake of technicalities since, the act has still 
yet to clarify such, which can otherwise provide a blanket for animals who are seen in pet stores more frequently today.
</p>


<p>In Massachusetts, regulations and policies lay ground rules concerning the conduct of pet
retailers. Pet stores must ‚Äúbe licensed under the laws of the Commonwealth‚Ä¶ [are] required to
work with their veterinary medical staff to ensure compliance with all local, state and federal
requirements, as well as conformance with generally accepted, current practice standards within
the field of veterinary medicine,‚Äù and, additionally, possess the responsibilities of ‚Äúthe
maintenance of premises, buildings and conveyances, the health of the birds, mammals or
reptiles and the method and time of inspection and checking of said animals.‚Äù<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>7</sup></a>
 Mandating overall cleanliness of the store and evaluating physical
well-being of the animals through vet visits prior to being sold, these policies barely scrape the
surface of these said standards. While clarified that stores must uphold the standards of that
recommended by a veterinarian, what that exactly entails is left up to interpretation. One would
assume that veterinarians recommend the fulfillment of housing requirements and other means of
promoting quality of life, but how many pet stores truly pay mind to such? The consequences for
mistreating an animal to the extent where its health, safety, and welfare is compromised are
‚Äúadministrative penalties, suspension or revocation of licensure.‚Äù<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>7</sup></a> 
Because the terms 
of the policies are vague, nothing beyond blatant abuse can be 
considered intentional or inflicted by humans and therefore cannot warrant punishment. For 
instance, if a pet store wrongfully houses two or more solitary animals together, the pet store 
may not be held accountable for any injuries inflicted since the conflict was animal-to-animal, 
despite being indirectly caused by the humans who housed them together. Popular retailers tend 
to not be subject to inspections either, and those hypothetically conducting the inspection will 
focus their attention more on the store‚Äôs operations and its appearance to the public, not
seemingly miniscule attributes of small animal husbandry.
</p>

<p>Animal welfare laws hold immense value in establishing a baseline, but they offer little to
no focus beyond the bare minimum means of care; enrichment and promotion of quality of life is
dismissed. The list of faults seen within pet store enclosures is endless and is especially notable
to any individual with experience in caring for animals and knows the toll that improper housing
has on them: solitary animals being housed together, lack of bedding and space, bright lights, et
cetera- all of which have adverse, even long-term effects on the animal. Some faults are,
unfortunately, nearly impossible to avoid, such as noise- inevitable in a buzzling store- but
others, such as back-lit lights to "display" the animal to customers, can be dimmed to allow the
animal more comfort, especially considering the fact that they also have minimal bedding and
cannot sufficiently burrow and hide- disrupting their diurnal sleep cycles.
</p>

<p>Petco‚Äôs website features care guides for every pet that they sell, but a considerable
quantity of this information is simply false or contradictory to the conditions of which they
practice in-store. The advice listed for caring for dwarf hamsters includes providing a "minimum
habitat size [of] 24" L x 12" W x 12" H for single hamster" and mentions that "hamsters are
solitary animals, but dwarf hamsters may be kept in same-sex pairs if they are raised together."
<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>9</sup></a> The aforementioned habitat size scales to a ten-gallon tank, yet Petco
barely provides half of such for housing multiple hamsters together. Hamsters differ from other
rodents in the sense that they do not benefit from having a companion. Often, hamsters,  including
dwarfs- will fight and have the capacity to kill one another- even if they are from the
same litter. Regardless of habitat size or amount of food and enrichment provided, they are
bound to compete for resources. One too many times I have observed the hamsters at a pet store
and gaped at the lack of space, inadequate bedding, and other meager aspects of their housing
conditions; unsurprisingly, the hamsters were, indeed, brawling. These instances contribute
toward my origin story for purchasing my current hamster, who was only a few scuffles away
from him and his littermate becoming seriously injured. My action of "saving" a hamster,
however, is not a solution to the issue and certainly nothing more than a benevolent endeavor.
When a hamster, or any animal in a pet store for that matter, is purchased, their enclosure is
stocked with another, and the cycle continues.
</p>

<p>These habitats are sustainable in the short‚Äìterm, such as for transportation purposes, but
most animals are at the pet store for substantial amounts of time before they are purchased and
brought home. Depending on the popularity of the particular pet or the location of the store itself,
weeks can pass before the animal is finally brought to a home- at least among the pet stores I
have frequented. Hopefully, owners are knowledgeable on proper care, as they should conduct
plentiful research prior to purchasing or adopting any pet. Nonetheless, many are misinformed or
simply lack regard- arguing that a lack of a need to go above and beyond in regard to housing
pets is present, especially among pets on the smaller side. Pet owners who do not know any
better may see how an animal is housed at the pet store and model their habitat for the animal
they are purchasing in the same manner. Subsequently, improper housing conditions are extended 
from a fixed period of time in the pet store to a lifetime at home. Pet stores have no control 
over their animals once they are purchased but can take steps to educate owners on proper conditions 
via adjusting their in-store habitats and updating brochures with accurate information to hand new pet 
owners. Educating owners is vital, but solutions must start from the source.
</p>

<p>The care for small animals is rarely ever addressed, as dogs and cats take precedence in
the animal welfare discussion given their commonality as household pets. Some owners figure
smaller equals far less maintenance; others may consider smaller animals less sentient or
intelligent. Most of the time, people are indifferent towards treating them with proper care.
However, small stature is not a determining factor on sentience; all animals can feel discomfort,
boredom, and pain: all major effects of neglecting their need for appropriate living and
enrichment. Lack of enrichment is a prime stressor for pets, and in birds, can lead to
"self-mutilation, feather picking, chewing on cage bars and walls, fearfulness and excessive
aggression."<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>3</sup></a> Not only are these actions concerning for the
wellbeing of the animal but also the latter behaviors tend to be persistent- leading to trust between the
pet and their future owner becoming disrupted and faltering their emotional attachment with one
another.
</p>

<p>While the issue focuses on smaller, less commonly-owned animals due to how niche their
requirements are, this mistreatment extends to all pets: cats and dogs too, but some states have
acted by implementing bans. Currently, states other than those majorly of the south and midwest
have executed full state bans or allowed cities to independently decide on selling cats and dogs in
pet stores.<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>11</sup></a> California was the first state to do so in 2017
with law AB 485, "which prohibits pet stores from selling dogs, cats, and rabbits unless they are
obtained from a shelter or rescue organization."<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>6</sup></a> 
The City of Boston also implemented
this ban a year prior, referred to as "the puppy mill bill."<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>2</sup></a>
An evident difference between larger pets- cats, dogs, and even rabbits versus smaller pets- rodents, birds, 
reptiles- is the former is arguably more high-maintenance. All
animals require enrichment and other means of providing wellness and happiness, but dogs in
particular need ample space to promote activity, as well as to be taken on walks throughout the
day: a difficult task to complete in a pet store- rendering the ban a necessary feat. Without the
ban, many pet stores will provide cats and dogs with far less than adequate conditions,
potentially neglect their activity requirement, and endorse receiving them from puppy mills, a
separate issue in and of itself. One pet store in particular, Petland, faced a ‚Äúclass action
lawsuit‚Ä¶and the chain‚Äôs Kennesaw, Georgia location‚Äù due to the chain supplying their animals
from unethical breeders.<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>6</sup></a> With a greater number of people 
advocating for what is right,
if they have been driven to the lawsuit level, others who believe in the cause can rally for better
conditions of smaller animals in these stores.
</p>

<p>In the grand scheme, pet stores operate under an identical mentality as many other
companies: money is the priority. An editorial renders pet stores as "simply an industry looking
to make a profit."<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>10</sup></a> Given their poor housing conditions, animals 
are no more than a mere
product on the shelf. Even under the Uniform Commercial Code, "companion animals are
considered <span><i>goods</i></span>."<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>5</sup></a> Evidently, corporations cannot care 
less about if they are feeling
distressed, if they are ill, or what they face from the breeders who source them, as long as they
get sold so the company can keep earning money. If an animal is sick, the employees themselves assuming they care- do what they can to keep the animal comfortable, but they cannot truly be
comfortable unless they have proper means of housing. Sick or injured animals are simply
discounted, similar to a defective item on clearance in a store. Having a small pet fall ill soon
after bringing them home is traumatic but is likely to "result in frustration for the owner and even
the eventual abandonment of the pet."<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>12</sup></a> An animal falling ill due to
genetics or another external factor is one matter, but becoming sick under the pet store‚Äôs control
or discretion is quite another.
</p>

<p>The process of mitigation in order to cease such conditions is simple in theory but holds a
questionable degree of plausibility, given the nature of companies. Many employees spend time
and effort caring for these animals to the best of their ability and knowledge, but one can only do
so much with what they are provided. Companies possess full responsibility to ensure that their
locations fit these conditions. Lack of funds is not a factor here, as unlike small businesses, large
corporations can absorb the cost. They can afford to implement "larger facilities so animals have
more space" alongside larger tanks, more bedding, better accessories, and enrichment but choose
not to do so.<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>10</sup></a> If pet stores stressed the importance of enrichment 
to owners, their revenue
would likely be enhanced. Corporate stores cannot be relied upon to provide animals with more
than the bare minimum. Amendments to the Animal Welfare Act, as well as individual laws and
regulations that explicitly stress the importance of above-and-beyond conditions, will mandate
these better conditions, not simply encourage them.

</p>
<p>In addition, pushing for the continuation of laws being passed or amendments to current
ones can only happen if awareness is spread and education grows. Recently, people have
expressed their experiences and disheartenment on social media by recording animals displaying
adverse behaviors and fighting. Many animal shelters and veterinary clinics are a part of the
movement for change. MSPCA-Angell encourages customers to contact the MSPCA‚Äôs law
enforcement department, the Division of Animal Health, or their local Animal Rescue League if
they find violations of the current regulations, but these regulations must be amended to
encompass the conditions that may not seem crucial on the surface.<a href="#Works_Cited"><sup>8</sup></a>  
Pet store employees and customers alike want what is best for their animals, but they
cannot push for the correct means of change if they lack the education of what is right versus
wrong for pets. In the case of employees, better training materials can be provided; for the
public, better vetted, concise information should be available and made accessible.

<p>With heightened awareness and additional push for amended or new legislation, pet
stores‚Äô ongoing faults will be clarified and mandate the proper care for animals in pet stores, not
solely the bare minimum. Confronting this issue is not to advocate for the total elimination of
such pet stores or even to ban the sale of smaller pets. Dogs, cats, and rabbits are better suited in
an animal shelter or with ethical breeders, but smaller animals have the potential to exist in a
fulfilling manner in pet stores and can continue to be sold. Enforcing proper care in-store gives
small animals a proper beginning to their lives and models good care for potential owners. In the
end, pet ownership should always be an exercise in empathy for even the smallest of creatures.
