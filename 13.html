				<!-- Paragraphs -->
								
<p>Diabetes mellitus is a disease that occurs when the pancreas cannot sufficiently regulate an animal‚Äôs blood sugar- leading to excessive glucose in the blood that is unable to be used by the cells for energy. It is relatively common and affects 1 in every 300 patients, which are mostly middle-aged to elderly dogs and cats. </p>

<p>There are three types:<br>

Type I: Insulin-producing cells are almost destroyed.<br>
Type II: Insulin-producing cells are somewhat present, but insulin is insufficient.<br>
Type III: Insulin resistance caused by other hormones, pregnancy, and/or tumors</p>

<p>Clinical signs: <br>
‚Ä¢	Increased urination as the body tries to eliminate the excessive amounts of glucose. <br>
‚Ä¢	Increased thirst due to dehydration from the increased urination. <br>
‚Ä¢	Increased appetite as the body cannot use glucose for energy. <br>
‚Ä¢	Weight loss as the body breaks down fat and protein stores to compensate for the energy loss. </p>

<p>The proper treatment for diabetes mellitus differs based on the type. Type I is treated with two insulin injections QD. Type II and Type III are treated with oral medications, such as corticosteroids and progestogens. For all types, pets should also be fed a nutritious diet. </p>


<p>Diabetes can be diagnosed by a veterinarian given the typical symptoms being displayed by the animal and excessive/present glucose in the blood and urine upon lab tests. To prevent diabetes, owners should provide their pets with a healthy, well-balanced diet that is high in protein and low in carbohydrates in order to maintain a blood sugar level that is steady, as well as promote regular exercise.</p>

<p>Navigating the complexities of diabetes can feel overwhelming, but understanding the condition is the first step toward helping our cats and dogs lead healthy lives. </p>
