				<!-- Paragraphs -->
								
								<p>There’s something surreal about being 15 years old and learning how to perform CPR on a golden retriever. Granted, it wasn’t a real dog, but rather a life-sized stuffed animal designed to look somewhat lifelike, if not slightly deflated. At Essex North Shore Agricultural & Technical School, we didn’t have time for second thoughts. In our sophomore-year Veterinary Science class, we were becoming certified in Pet First Aid and CPR, preparing for emergencies as if our basements were about to be converted into ERs for Labradors and tabbies.</p>
								<p>Pet First Aid, I soon learned, was a collection of skills that make you feel both competent and absurd at the same time. It covers everything from bandaging and choking treatment to managing seizures and exposure to toxic substances. There’s an unspoken hope you’ll never actually have to use these skills, like knowing how to escape a sinking car or perform a tracheotomy with a ballpoint pen.</p>
								<p>The first thing you learn is that calm efficiency is crucial. If there’s one thing a pet in crisis doesn’t need, it’s you hyperventilating over its unconscious body or fumbling with gauze as if it were a Rubik’s Cube. No, you’re supposed to swoop in like a canine superhero, confident and unflappable, even if inside you’re screaming, “This is not what I signed up for!”</p>
								<p>One of the more surreal parts of the training involved making an emergency muzzle. If the animal is fractious—our teacher’s polite way of saying "in freak-out mode"—it might need a muzzle to prevent it from biting you while you’re heroically trying to save its life. Muzzling an unconscious animal feels a bit like locking the doors to an empty house, but who am I to argue with established protocols? Using a long strip of fabric, you create a loop, slip it over the dog’s snout, draw it snug but not tight, and tie a bow with the ends. If nothing else, you’ve given the dog a charming accessory.</p>
								<p>Of course, you don’t muzzle if the animal is vomiting, seizing, or struggling to breathe—common sense, unless you’re in the middle of an emergency and have temporarily misplaced yours. If there’s a wound involved, you grab whatever’s handy—a sweatshirt, a towel, a napkin if you’re desperate—and apply pressure. You never remove the fabric once it’s in place; just keep layering more on top, like a makeshift lasagna, to help stop the bleeding. It’s the animal’s platelets that will save the day; you’re merely a helpful bystander who happens to be sweating profusely.</p>
								<p>Then there’s CPR, which is as straightforward as any life-saving technique that requires adjusting for the size, shape, and chest circumference of various species can be. You assess the scene first. Did Fido collapse from excitement upon seeing you, or is there an actual emergency? After confirming the dog isn’t playing dead as a practical joke, you check its breathing and open its airway.</p>
								<p>The stuffed retriever we practiced on didn’t seem to mind our clumsy technique. For smaller animals, we were taught to grasp their tiny chests with one hand and squeeze like we were inflating a beach ball. Larger dogs required a different approach—one hand on the chest and the other on the floor as an anchor. The real challenge, however, was the barrel-chested breeds, who need to be placed on their backs for the compressions, making them look like they’re begging for belly rubs while you’re desperately trying to save their life.</p>
								<p>CPR for animals involves 30 compressions followed by two rescue breaths. For the breaths, you place your mouth over the dog’s snout and exhale, which sounds more intimate than it is. In truth, you’re just praying that the dog doesn’t come to mid-breath and decide that biting your nose off is the appropriate thank-you gesture. You repeat this pattern five times before checking the pulse—if there is one. If there isn’t, it’s back to the compressions while mentally drafting an apology to the dog’s owner.</p>
								<p>By the end of the training, we were all newly minted Pet First Aid and CPR certified sophomores, ready to take on emergencies with varying degrees of competence. I left with a sense of cautious optimism that if my own pet collapsed one day, I’d be able to do more than just wave a bag of treats in its face and hope for the best.</p>
